CS 1515 Docker
=============

The Docker container-based virtualization service lets you run a
minimal CS 1515 environment, including Linux, on a macOS or Windows
computer, without the overhead of a full virtual machine like VMware
Workstation, VMware Fusion, or VirtualBox.

It should be possible to do *all* CS 1515 assignments in the CS 1515
Docker container.

Advantages of Docker:

* Docker can start and stop containers incredibly quickly.
* Docker-based containers are small and occupy little space on your machine.
* With Docker, you can easily *edit* your code in your home environment, but
  *compile and run* it on a Linux host.

Disadvantages of Docker:

* Docker does not offer a graphical environment. You will need to run all CS
  1515 programs exclusively in the terminal.
* Docker technology is less user-friendly than virtual machines. You’ll have
  to type weird commands.
* You won’t get the fun, different feeling of a graphical Linux desktop,
  like the one you see in lectures..

## Downloading the CS 1515 Docker container from DockerHub
We've pre-built the container and uploaded an image of it onto DockerHub (it is like GitHub but for managing Docker images). You can run our script that will automatically download the pre-built image for you to use. This is the **preferred solution**. 

1.  Download and install [Docker][].

2.  From this directory, run the following command: 
  
    ```shellsession
    $ ./cs1515-setup-docker
    ```

    This will pull the latest image suitable for your computer, and tag it `cs1515:latest` or `cs1515:arm64` depending on your computer architecture. 
  
When we make updates to the Docker image, you can rerun the script to update the image. 
## Building the CS 1515 Docker container from scratch
While it is much more convenient to pull the Docker image from DockerHub (see above), you can also build the Docker image from scratch (you will likely never need to do this). This takes ~10-20 minutes to build. 

1.  Download and install [Docker][].

2.  From this directory, run this command. It will take a while (up to 20
    minutes) and will use a few GB of disk space.

    ```shellsession
    $ ./cs1515-build-docker
    ```

    The command starts up a virtual Linux-based computer running inside your
    computer. It then installs a bunch of software useful for CS 1515 on that
    environment, then takes a snapshot of the running environment. (The
    snapshot has a name, such as `cs1515:latest` or `cs1515:arm64`.) Once the
    snapshot is created, it’ll take just a second or so for Docker to restart
    it.

    The script will attempt to ask for authentication to be able to tag and push the image. At this point, you may exit the script if you only wish to have a built image. 

We may need to change the Docker image during the semester. If we do, you’ll
update your repository to get the latest Dockerfile, then re-run the
`./cs1515-build-docker` command from step 2. However, later runs should be
faster since they’ll take advantage of your previous work.

For these reasons, it is **highly recommended** that you pull the image from DockerHub. 

> `./cs1515-build-docker` is a wrapper around `docker build`. On x86-64 hosts, it runs
> `docker build -t cs1515:latest -f Dockerfile --platform linux/amd64`.

## Running the CS 1515 Docker container by script

In the parent directory of this one (the cs1515-devenv repository root), you'll
find a file called `cs1515-run-docker`. This is a script that runs your CS 1515
Docker container.

For example, here’s an example of running CS 1515 Docker on a macOS host. At
first, `uname` (a program that prints the name of the currently running
operating system) reports `Darwin` (the name of the macOS kernel). But after
`./cs1515-run-docker` connects the terminal to a Linux container, `uname`
reports `Linux`. At the end of the example, `exit` quits the Docker
environment and returns the terminal to macOS.

```shellsession
$ uname
Darwin
$ uname -a
Darwin bashful.local 21.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 21.1.0: Wed Oct 13 17:33:24 PDT 2021; root:xnu-8019.41.5~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T8101 arm64
$ ./cs1515-run-docker
cs1515-user@a47f05ea5085:~$ uname
Linux
cs1515-user@a47f05ea5085:~$ uname -a
Linux 4f789b721d16 5.10.47-linuxkit #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Jul 3 21:50:16 UTC 2021 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
cs1515-user@a47f05ea5085:~$ exit
exit
$
```

A prompt like `cs1515-user@a47f05ea5085:~$` means that your terminal is
connected to the container. (The `a47f05ea5085` part is a unique identifier for this
running container.) You can execute any Linux commands you want. To escape from the
container, type Control-D or run the `exit` command.

The script assumes your Docker container is named `cs1515:latest` or `cs1515:arm64`.


### Running CS 1515 Docker by hand

If you don’t want to use the script, use a command like the following.

```shellsession
$ docker run -it --platform linux/amd64 -v ~/cs1515-s22-devenv/home:/home/cs1515-user cs1515:latest
```

Explanation:

* `docker run` tells Docker to start a new virtual machine.
* `-it` says Docker should run interactively (`-i`) using a terminal (`-t`).
* `--platform linux/amd64` says Docker should emulate an x86-64-based machine.
  It’s necessary to specify this if you have (for example) an Apple M1-based
  laptop and are working on assignments that require an x86-64 Intel machine.
* `-v LOCALDIR:LINUXDIR` says Docker should share a directory between your
  host and the Docker container. Here, I’ve asked for the host’s
  `~/cs1515-s22-devenv/home` directory to be mapped inside the container
  onto the `/home/cs1515-user` directory, which is the virtual machine
  user’s home directory.
* `cs1515:latest` names the Docker image to run (namely, the one you built).

Here’s an example session:

```shellsession
$ docker run -it --platform linux/amd64 --rm -v ~/cs1515-s22-devenv/home:/home/cs1515-user cs1515:latest
cs1515-user@a15e6c4c8dbe:~$ ls
cs1515-s22-projects
cs1515-user@a15e6c4c8dbe:~$ echo "Hello, world"
Hello, world
cs1515-user@a15e6c4c8dbe:~$ cs1515-docker-version
1
cs1515-user@a15e6c4c8dbe:~$ exit
exit
$
```
